## Backgroud Imformation

The **Stroop effect** is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of
a task. When the name of a color (e.g. "blue", "green", or "red") is printed in 
a color that is not denoted by the name (e.g. the word "red" printed in blue ink
instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone
to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color.

**Congruent** words condition: the words being displayed are color words whose 
names match the colors in which they are printed. For example:

**Incongruent** words condition: the words being displayed are color words whose
names **do not** match the colors in which they are printed. For example:

## Data Exploration

The sample size for the data we are going to use is 24. Including the time used 
to finishe Congruent and Incongruent tests. First explore the data by
plotting histgram and density plot. We can see the average time used for 
Congruent test is around 13 and 21 for Incongruent test.


```{r set dirctory and input data}
setwd("E:/Udacity/Data Analyst/Statistic Project")

library(ggplot2) #must load the ggplot package first
library(dplyr)
library(gridExtra)

# bring in the data set
test_data <- read.csv("Stroop Test Data.csv", header = TRUE, fill = TRUE, 
                      sep = ",", row.names = NULL)

trans_data <- read.csv("Stroop Test Data_2.csv", header = TRUE, fill = TRUE, 
                       sep = ",", row.names = NULL)
```


```{r plot histogram for data}
grid.arrange(ggplot(data = test_data, aes(x=Congruent)) +
                 geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "grey", color = "black"),
             ggplot(data = test_data, aes(x=Incongruent)) +
                 geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "grey", color = "black"), 
             nrow =1)
```

```{r plot density and distribution line}
grid.arrange(ggplot(data = test_data, aes(x=Congruent, y = ..density..)) +
                 geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "grey", color = "black") +
                 geom_density(alpha=.2, color = "red"),
             ggplot(data = test_data, aes(x=Incongruent, y = ..density..)) +
                 geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "grey", color = "black") +
                 geom_density(alpha=.2, color = "red"),
             nrow =1)
```

By plotting the two tests results into one plot, we can clearly see that nomally
the time used in Congruent test is less.

```{r conbine two plots into one}
ggplot(data = trans_data, aes(x = Time, y = ..density.., fill = Type)) + 
    geom_histogram(alpha=0.5, binwidth = 1, position="identity", 
                   color = "black") +
    geom_density(alpha=.2)
```

## Questions For Investigation

1. Variable
    + Independent Variable: Time used (in seconds) to finishe the test
    + Dependent Variable: Type of the test (Congruent or Incongruent)
    
    
2. Hypotheses Test: since we don't know the mean and standard deviation of the
entire population, we can't use z-test. And the data set we have are the 
participants from two paired trials. So we need to use 
**one-tail dependent t-test in the negative direction**.
    + **Null hypothesis**: The congruent response time is greater or there is no
    siginificant difference in the population average amount of time it takes to
    state the colors of the words in a congruent or incongruent condition.
    + **Alternative hypothesis**: The congruent response time is lessin the 
    population average amount of time it takes to state the colors of the words 
    in a congruent or incongruent condition
    
3. Written in mathematical symbols
    + $H_0 : \mu_C >= \mu_I$
    + $H_A : \mu_C < \mu_I$
    
    or
    
    + $H_0 : \mu_D >= 0$
    + $H_A : \mu_D < 0$

***

##Hypotheses Test

First calculate the t-critical value at an alpha level of 0.05: Since sample
size is 24, the degrees of freedom is 23. Look up on t-table, when alpha level
is 0.05, and one-tail on the left side, the t-critical value is **-1.714**.

Then calculate sample mean, Standard Deviation and t statistic:

$$\bar{X_D} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_{ci} - X_{Ii})}{n} = -7.96$$
$$S_D = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(\bar{D}-d_i)^2}{n-1}} = 4.86$$
$$t = \frac{\bar{X_D}}{S_D / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{7.96}{4.86/\sqrt{24}} = -8.02$$

Since $-8.02< -1.714$, reject $H_0$ hypotheses. The time used to finishe the 
Congruent test is less.
