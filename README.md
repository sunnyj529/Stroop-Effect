# Stroop-Effect

The **Stroop effect** is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task. When the name of a color (e.g. “blue”, “green”, or “red”) is printed in a color that is not denoted by the name (e.g. the word “red” printed in blue ink instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color.

**Congruent** words condition: the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed.

**Incongruent** words condition: the words being displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed.

- Used R to do data exploration by plotting histogram and density plot
- Used Hypotheses Test to prove that we will reject **H0** hypotheses. The time used to finished the Congruent test is less
- Used R Markdown to document the process and findings
